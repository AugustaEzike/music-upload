MVP
These are meant to be shown off on your résumé under a section called “Other Experience”. These show potential employers that you are passionate about what you do and about learning. They also show you are original, as the concepts for these projects should be novel. Whatever type of project you are trying to do, there will be others doing similar projects. If you are just trying to learn something new, you can repeat the same tutorial or recreate the same basic project you’ve seen others do a thousand times. No employer is impressed by seeing “yet another XYZ project”, they’ve seen those before. It just shows that you can follow a tutorial.
For a résumé project, your goal is to create something interesting and novel. It should be a concept that has not been done a thousand times before. It doesn’t need to be a finished, scalable project that could be turned into a business tomorrow. It just needs to be functional, limited in scope, and polished. It should look finished. You are permitted to use one new technology in a résumé project, IF the company you are applying for uses that technology. Any more new stuff will slow you down and make you take longer to complete the project than your 2 week deadline.
Time to complete a Résumé Project: ~2 weeks to build a demo/proof of concept, and then 1 week polishing it. Don’t go over 3 weeks.
